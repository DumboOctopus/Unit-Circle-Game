# Unit-Circle-Game
This is a game to help poor precalc honors students survive mr koci timed unit circle test.
It drill the user with angles and asks them to show where that angles lies on the unit circle.
Once students are good at finding where angles are, it is trivial for them to calculate the sin, cos and tan
given the angle. 

cos is just how far it is in the x direction 
sin is how far it is in the y direction
tan is just the slope of the line

yeah...
