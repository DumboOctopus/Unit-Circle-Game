 * IT IS THe unit circle thingy. I might want to have a UnitCircle listener instead of a unitcircleWindow for the controllers
 * Idk tho. Maybe i can have both :) Or maybe in the contructor, i could set a designated method of the UnitCircleListener
 * interface to run every time the main buton is clicked. That is all the Unit Circle Window listener does that
 * is not related to the UNit Circle. MEh but its more centralized that way...Not sure hehehe what should i do kalsdfjl;asdjf
